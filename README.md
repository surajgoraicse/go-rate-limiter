# Rate Limiter Playground (Go)

This repository is a **learning-first, iteration-driven implementation of rate limiters in Go**.

The goal is to start from the **most basic correct implementation** and progressively evolve it into a **production-grade, distributed rate limiter**.

Each iteration lives in its own directory and builds on the previous one conceptually, not by copying complexity blindly.

> Rate Limiter : A rate limiter is a system that controls the rate at which requests are processed. It ensures that the system does not become overwhelmed by too many requests.
